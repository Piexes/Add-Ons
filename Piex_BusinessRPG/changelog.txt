Okay. If it's going to be a CityRPG, or something like it, I need to know
how he programmed lots. Also, the onTrigger bricks and the baton. Might
need to get my hands a bit dirty. Maybe the things you can do can be
education based, for example if you get a law degree you can fight in
lawsuits. And if you buy a baton, you can arrest people. Maybe
degrees add a small bit to your salary. Yeah. But so if you're going
to make this, you need a builder. That's fine. If the mod is impressive,
they will come. We need a VERY orderly way to do this, so you don't give
up on it. Don't. Give. Up. Before you start programming parts, know
what you're doing. Make an isolated mod for just an economy, for example.
Then, all you have to do is peice it together. Make numerous isolated
mods before you start working on the actual project. Start crunching
numbers.
